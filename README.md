##### Embedded Target System using STM32F3 ARM Cortex-M Microcontroller #####

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Firmware for the Embedded Target System is developed in C to control the various Peripherals (GPIOs, USART, ADCs, Timers etc.) to    develop various real-time embedded applications. 

*Various Hardwares such as LCD, Stepper motor, DC motor, Tachometer, Sensors, RS-232 etc. could interfaced to the system with ease.

*Diagnostic tools like Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyser, Multimeters etc. could be used to ensure the System’s proper functioning.

*This Embedded Target System has the following interfaces:
● 8 Open collector drivers
● H-Bridge driver
● Tachometer interface
● Character LCD interface
● RS-232 level interface
● Analog input and outputs
● STM32F303VCT6 Discovery board interface
